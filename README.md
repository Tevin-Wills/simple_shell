0x16. C - Simple Shell

This is the final sprint of C programming

we close it with the simple shell project 
a project by ALX SE foundation to test the knowlege and understanding 
of their C programming

The rpoject contains codes written in C programming used in unix shell

At the end pf the project, Learners should be able to do the following:
Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system
Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)
Who is Ken Thompson
How does a shell work
What is a pid and a ppid
How to manipulate the environment of the current process
What is the difference between a function and a system call
How to create processes
What are the three prototypes of main
How does the shell use the PATH to find the programs
How to execute another program with the execve system call
How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates
What is EOF / “end-of-file”?

Have a great time reviwing this MASTER PIECE!!
